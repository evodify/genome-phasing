# Genome phasing
This is a pipeline to phase a genome into two homeologous subgenomes. This phasing approach requires parental genomes.

The phasing is performed in two stages:

1) Generate phased haplotype blocks using HapCUT.
2) Merge haplotype block into two continuous strings


Preparing reference parental genomes performed as an intermediate step.
